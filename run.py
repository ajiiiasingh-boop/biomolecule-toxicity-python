run.py — one-click launcher for the website.

Double-click this file, or type:   python run.py

It does three things:
  1. checks that your Python is new enough (3.10 or later),
  2. installs the libraries listed in requirements.txt (only when they are missing),
  3. starts the website, which opens in your browser at http://localhost:8501

Press Ctrl+C in this window to stop the website.
